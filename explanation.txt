Backend ----------

1. create the project in venv (like in ./backend/ directory)
2. pip install pyinstaller
3. pyinstaller --name backend --onefile main.py (to create build & dist folder)
4. the main.exe in dist folder has all the python code

Frontend ----------

1. npm install -g pkg
2. create server.js 
3. update package.json (to contain "pkg" attribute)
4. npm run build (to create build folder)
5. pkg server.js --output frontend.exe
6. ensure that frontend.exe & build folder have the same parent directory

Send to client ----------

1. We only need to send ./backend_client/ & ./frontend_client/ folder to client
2. As it contains only exe & build files, code is hidden sufficiently
